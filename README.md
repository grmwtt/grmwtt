# Hey there! I'm Griffin 👋

I'm a grad student at Virginia Tech who gets excited about building intelligent systems. Currently deep in the world of **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and trying to make models that actually work in production (not just in notebooks 😄).

## 🎯 What Drives Me
I love the challenge of taking complex ML research and turning it into something practical and deployable. Whether it's training RL agents, fine-tuning transformers, or optimizing graph neural networks - I'm all about building systems that solve real problems.

## 🔭 Current Projects
- **Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent** - Teaching an AI to trade stocks (and hopefully not lose all its money)
- **Multi-Modal VQA System** - Combining vision and language so models can actually understand images
- **Molecular Property Prediction with GNNs** - Using graph neural networks for drug discovery applications

## 🧰 Technical Toolbox
**Core:** Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, SQL  
**ML Specialties:** Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, Reinforcement Learning  
**Engineering:** Git, Docker, MLflow, FastAPI, Linux  
**Always Learning:** MLOps, Graph Neural Networks, Causal Inference

## 📚 Education
**Virginia Tech**
- M.S. in Data Science (Accelerated) - Expected 2027
- B.S. in Computational Modeling & Data Analytics - 3.44 GPA
- Minors: CS, Statistics, Mathematics
