# Hey there! I'm Griffin

I'm an undergrad/grad student at Virginia Tech who gets excited about building intelligent systems. Currently deep in the world of **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **AI applications**, and trying to make models that actually work in production (not just in notebooks).

## What Drives Me

I'm passionate about machine learning and applying it to solve real-world problems. I'm currently building my skills through hands-on projects in supervised fine-tuning (SFT), predictive modeling, and robust pipeline construction. I'm excited to explore deep learning, reinforcement learning, and other advanced ML techniques as I continue to grow in this field.

## Technical Stack
- **Programming**: Python, R, SQL, C, Java
- **ML/Data Science**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PyTorch, Transformers, Unsloth, PEFT, TRL, HuggingFace Datasets
- **Machine Learning**: Regression, Classification (kNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest), Clustering (k-means, PCA), LLM Fine-Tuning (LoRA/QLoRA)
- **Tools**: Jupyter, RStudio, VS Code, Git/GitHub, Google Colab, PowerBI, Linux/Bash
- **Databases/ETL**: SQL Server, API Integration, Web Scraping, Data Cleaning/Feature Engineering
- **Currently Exploring**: Reinforcement Learning, NLP, Deep Learning, Multi-Agent Systems
