# Hey there! I'm Griffin

I'm a grad student at Virginia Tech who gets excited about building intelligent systems. Currently deep in the world of **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and trying to make models that actually work in production (not just in notebooks).

## What Drives Me

I love the challenge of taking complex ML research and turning it into something practical and deployable. Whether it's training RL agents, fine-tuning transformers, or optimizing graph neural networks - I'm all about building systems that solve real problems.

## Current Projects

**Network Anomaly Detection System** — Building an unsupervised ML system that detects cyber attacks by learning normal network behavior patterns using autoencoders and LSTMs

**Multi-Modal Visual Question Answering** — Developing a vision-language model that answers questions about images using transformers and cross-modal attention mechanisms

## Technical Stack

**Core:** Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, SQL  
**ML Specialties:** Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, Reinforcement Learning  
**Engineering:** Git, Docker, MLflow, FastAPI, Linux  
**Always Learning:** MLOps, Graph Neural Networks, Causal Inference

## Education

**Virginia Tech**  
M.S. in Data Science (Accelerated) — Expected 2027  
B.S. in Computational Modeling & Data Analytics — 3.44 GPA  
Minors: CS, Statistics, Mathematics
